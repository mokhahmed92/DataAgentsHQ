# Data Processing Agents

## Overview
Data Processing Agents is a powerful, modular framework for building and orchestrating intelligent data transformation pipelines. These AI-enhanced agents automate complex data processing tasks while maintaining flexibility for custom workflows across batch, streaming, and event-driven architectures.
Ideal for data engineers and analysts, this toolkit simplifies ETL/ELT operations, data preparation, and feature engineering at scale - reducing boilerplate code while increasing processing efficiency and reliability.
